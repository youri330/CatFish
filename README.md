## Project Overview
This is a 2D pixel art RPG project that I developed for my university coursework. It features a variety of characters with different abilities, as well as a combat system that supports both magical and physical combat.

## Features
- **Character Variety**: The game includes a set of characters, each with unique abilities and playstyles. Some characters specialize in magical abilities, while others focus on physical combat.
- **Pixel Art Visuals**: The game's graphics are built using pixel art, creating a retro-inspired visual style.
- **Unity and C# Implementation**: The project is developed using the Unity game engine and the C# programming language.
